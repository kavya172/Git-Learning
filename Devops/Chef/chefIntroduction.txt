To create Cook Book
    chef generate cookbook cookBookName
To create Reciepe
    chef generate recipe recipeName
To check specification 
    chef spec ruby -c path

chef-client -zr "recipe[path]"

   >> -z:  This option tells the Chef client to run in local mode,
     which means that it will not communicate with a Chef server 
     and will instead read its configuration and recipes from the local system.

   >> -r "recipe[path]": This option specifies the recipe that should be
    applied by the Chef client. In this case, the recipe is specified as recipe[path],
     where recipe is a directory containing the recipe and path is the name of the recipe file.
