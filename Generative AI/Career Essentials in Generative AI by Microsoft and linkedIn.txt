=> A notebook is a tool for writing and running the code.
=> An Application is an exapmple of how a model can be used.
=> An Outcome is what the end users produces using generative AI or a notebook that houses a model.

Natural Language Models

=> GPT  => Large scale.
	=> Transform architecture.
	=> Human Like Text generation.

=> GPT Limitations

	=> Lack of creativity.
	=> No understanding of generated text.
	=> Biased Databases.
	=> danger of normalization of mediocity with creative writing.
